# Character Viewer

### OVERVIEW

The character viewer is a web-app to browse the characters provided by a GraphQL API

### GOALS

1. Allow the user to browse a list of characters of the show Rick & Morty.
2. Present the retrieved characters and their image in an elegant and logical manner (think
   about what a user would like to be able to do).
3. Allow the user to expand a character to see more details such as episodes they appeared in.

### SPECIFICATIONS

Use Typescript, React and Next.js (or equivalent) and any method for consuming a GraphQL api
you wish. Use any css frameworks or other helper libraries as you choose. Deploy your app using a
quick deployment tool such as Vercel and provide a link to a git repository.

We are looking for an expression of what you are able to do. This project is the occasion to
showcase what you are good at. You should produce a piece of software that is functioning and is
cleanly coded.

The user interface should be mobile responsive, functional and good looking. Use the homepage of
https://rickandmortyapi.com/ as a baseline for what is expected, but if you want to be creative and
try something different, go ahead.

There is a GraphQL playground at https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql and full documentation of
the API at https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation.

### BONUS FEATURES

- Provide filtering / search functionality (or other features provided by API)
- Beautiful and functional UI and animations
- Clean code, good component composition, separation of concerns
- Tested components and unit tests
- Full git history
